    <p>Can I tell you something?</p>
    <p>I stress about money.</p>
    <p>
      Astonishing, I know. I suppose I share that sentiment with 99.99999% of
      other people on the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUT my money stress has started to go way down. Primarily because I
      finally started to educate myself about personal finance, what actually
      works and moves the needle, and what’s mostly marketing hype.

    <h3>
      Hi, I’m Christian Bell, and this is my journey to fix my finances with
      software development.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Want an example? I finally have a real emergency fund saved up – 6 months
      of living expenses. You know how people talk about having their sh*t
      together? Well I didn’t. That’s the short version. There’s a long version
      but it’s, well, longer. The point is I’m actually starting to make real
      progress towards my goals. (helllloooo adulting!) I can’t tell you what
      will work for you. But I can tell you what’s been working for me. And how
      I’m speeding it up. (more money, faster)
